## Project Description
Sweetledger is a web-based accounting ledger book system. It allows users to utilize a fully functioning digital ledger book that businesses use. The completion of Sweetledger is composed of 5 different sprints, with each sprint building and adding functionalities off of the previous sprint. It is extremely efficient and robust, as the developing team has adopted a "less moving parts" mentality. There are more details of what that means in the following section.

## Environment
The backbone of Sweetledger is reliable and strong. We use AWS tools like AWS Elastic Beanstalk for hosting Sweetledger and MongoDB as Sweetledger's database. As long as AWS is available, Sweetledger will be available for all to use. The front of Sweetledger is made up from technologies and languages such as: C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vite, and React.
